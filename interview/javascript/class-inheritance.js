// We have a simple cars object
var cars = {
  type:"sedan",
  wheels:4
};

// We want to inherit from the cars object, so we do:
var toyota = Object.create (cars); // now toyota inherits the properties from cars
console.log(toyota.type); // sedan

function inheritPrototype(childObject, parentObject) {
  // As discussed above, we use the Crockford’s method to copy the properties and methods from the parentObject onto the childObject
  // So the copyOfParent object now has everything the parentObject has 
  var copyOfParent = Object.create(parentObject.prototype);

  //Then we set the constructor of this new object to point to the childObject.
  // Why do we manually set the copyOfParent constructor here, see the explanation immediately following this code block.
  copyOfParent.constructor = childObject;

  // Then we set the childObject prototype to copyOfParent, so that the childObject can in turn inherit everything from copyOfParent (from parentObject)
  childObject.prototype = copyOfParent;
}

// We made a new object and overwrote its prototype with the parentObject prototype:
function F() {
}
F.prototype = parentObject.prototype;
// Then it was this new F object we assigned to copyOfParent.
// All of this was done inside the Object.create () method.

// Inheritance with the prototype chain:

// JavaScript objects have a link to a prototype object. When trying to access a property of an object, the
// property will not only be sought on the object but on the prototype of the object, the prototype of the
// prototype, and so on until either a property with a matching name is found or the end of the prototype
// chain is reached.

// Let's create an object o from function f with its own properties a and b:
let f = function () {
  this.a = 1;
  this.b = 2;
}
let o = new f(); // {a: 1, b: 2}

// add properties in f function's prototype
f.prototype.b = 3;
f.prototype.c = 4;

// do not set the prototype f.prototype = {b:3,c:4}; this will break the prototype chain
// o.[[Prototype]] has properties b and c.
// o.[[Prototype]].[[Prototype]] is Object.prototype.
// Finally, o.[[Prototype]].[[Prototype]].[[Prototype]] is null.
// This is the end of the prototype chain, as null,
// by definition, has no [[Prototype]].
// Thus, the full prototype chain looks like:
// {a: 1, b: 2} ---> {b: 3, c: 4} ---> Object.prototype ---> null

console.log(o.a); // 1
// Is there an 'a' own property on o? Yes, and its value is 1.

console.log(o.b); // 2
// Is there a 'b' own property on o? Yes, and its value is 2.
// The prototype also has a 'b' property, but it's not visited.
// This is called Property Shadowing

console.log(o.c); // 4
// Is there a 'c' own property on o? No, check its prototype.
// Is there a 'c' own property on o.[[Prototype]]? Yes, its value is 4.

console.log(o.d); // undefined
// Is there a 'd' own property on o? No, check its prototype.
// Is there a 'd' own property on o.[[Prototype]]? No, check its prototype.
// o.[[Prototype]].[[Prototype]] is Object.prototype and there is no 'd' property by default, check its prototype.
// o.[[Prototype]].[[Prototype]].[[Prototype]] is null, stop searching,
// no property found, return undefined.

// Inheriting "methods"

// JavaScript does not have "methods" in the form that class-based languages define them. In JavaScript,
// any function can be added to an object in the form of a property. An inherited function acts just as 
// any other property, including property shadowing as shown above (in this case, a form of method overriding).

var o = {
  a: 2,
  m: function() {
    return this.a + 1;
  }
};

console.log(o.m()); // 3
// When calling o.m in this case, 'this' refers to o

var p = Object.create(o);
// p is an object that inherits from o

p.a = 4; // creates a property 'a' on p
console.log(p.m()); // 5
// when p.m is called, 'this' refers to p.
// So when p inherits the function m of o,
// 'this.a' means p.a, the property 'a' of p

// Using prototypes in JavaScript
// Let's look at what happens behind the scenes in a bit more detail.
// In JavaScript, as mentioned above, functions are able to have properties. All functions have a special
// property named prototype. Please note that the code below is free-standing (it is safe to assume there
// is no other JavaScript on the webpage other than the below code). For the best learning experience,
// it is highly recommended that you open a console, navigate to the "console" tab, copy-and-paste in the
// below JavaScript code, and run it by pressing the Enter/Return key. (The console is included in most web
// browser's Developer Tools. More information is available for Firefox Developer Tools, Chrome DevTools,
// and Edge DevTools.)

function doSomething(){}
console.log( doSomething.prototype );
//  It does not matter how you declare the function; a
//  function in JavaScript will always have a default
//  prototype property — with one exception: an arrow
//  function doesn't have a default prototype property:
const doSomethingFromArrowFunction = () => {};
console.log( doSomethingFromArrowFunction.prototype );

// As seen above, doSomething() has a default prototype property, as demonstrated by the console.
// After running this code, the console should have displayed an object that looks similar to this.

{
  constructor: ƒ doSomething(),
  __proto__: {
      constructor: ƒ Object(),
      hasOwnProperty: ƒ hasOwnProperty(),
      isPrototypeOf: ƒ isPrototypeOf(),
      propertyIsEnumerable: ƒ propertyIsEnumerable(),
      toLocaleString: ƒ toLocaleString(),
      toString: ƒ toString(),
      valueOf: ƒ valueOf()
  }
}

// We can add properties to the prototype of doSomething(), as shown below.

function doSomething(){}
doSomething.prototype.foo = "bar";
console.log( doSomething.prototype );

{
  foo: "bar",
  constructor: ƒ doSomething(),
  __proto__: {
      constructor: ƒ Object(),
      hasOwnProperty: ƒ hasOwnProperty(),
      isPrototypeOf: ƒ isPrototypeOf(),
      propertyIsEnumerable: ƒ propertyIsEnumerable(),
      toLocaleString: ƒ toLocaleString(),
      toString: ƒ toString(),
      valueOf: ƒ valueOf()
  }
}

// We can now use the new operator to create an instance of doSomething() based on this prototype.
// To use the new operator, call the function normally except prefix it with new. Calling a function
// with the new operator returns an object that is an instance of the function. Properties can then
// be added onto this object.

// Try the following code:

function doSomething(){}
doSomething.prototype.foo = "bar"; // add a property onto the prototype
var doSomeInstancing = new doSomething();
doSomeInstancing.prop = "some value"; // add a property onto the object
console.log( doSomeInstancing );

// This results in an output similar to the following:
{
  prop: "some value",
  __proto__: {
      foo: "bar",
      constructor: ƒ doSomething(),
      __proto__: {
          constructor: ƒ Object(),
          hasOwnProperty: ƒ hasOwnProperty(),
          isPrototypeOf: ƒ isPrototypeOf(),
          propertyIsEnumerable: ƒ propertyIsEnumerable(),
          toLocaleString: ƒ toLocaleString(),
          toString: ƒ toString(),
          valueOf: ƒ valueOf()
      }
  }
}

// As seen above, the __proto__ of doSomeInstancing is doSomething.prototype. But, what does this do?
// When you access a property of doSomeInstancing, the browser first looks to see if doSomeInstancing
// has that property.

// If doSomeInstancing does not have the property, then the browser looks for the property in the __proto__
// of doSomeInstancing (a.k.a. doSomething.prototype). If the __proto__ of doSomeInstancing has the property
// being looked for, then that property on the __proto__ of doSomeInstancing is used.

// Otherwise, if the __proto__ of doSomeInstancing does not have the property, then the __proto__ of the
// __proto__ of doSomeInstancing is checked for the property. By default, the __proto__ of any function's
// prototype property is window.Object.prototype. So, the __proto__ of the __proto__ of doSomeInstancing
// (a.k.a. the __proto__ of doSomething.prototype (a.k.a. Object.prototype)) is then looked through for the
// property being searched for.

// If the property is not found in the __proto__ of the __proto__ of doSomeInstancing, then the __proto__ 
// of the __proto__ of the __proto__ of doSomeInstancing is looked through. However, there is a
// problem: the __proto__ of the __proto__ of the __proto__ of doSomeInstancing does not exist. Then, and
// only then, after the entire prototype chain of __proto__'s is looked through, and there are no more 
// __proto__s does the browser assert that the property does not exist and conclude that the value at the
// property is undefined.

// Let's try entering some more code into the console:

function doSomething(){}
doSomething.prototype.foo = "bar";
var doSomeInstancing = new doSomething();
doSomeInstancing.prop = "some value";
console.log("doSomeInstancing.prop:      " + doSomeInstancing.prop);
console.log("doSomeInstancing.foo:       " + doSomeInstancing.foo);
console.log("doSomething.prop:           " + doSomething.prop);
console.log("doSomething.foo:            " + doSomething.foo);
console.log("doSomething.prototype.prop: " + doSomething.prototype.prop);
console.log("doSomething.prototype.foo:  " + doSomething.prototype.foo);

// This results in the following:

doSomeInstancing.prop:      some value
doSomeInstancing.foo:       bar
doSomething.prop:           undefined
doSomething.foo:            undefined
doSomething.prototype.prop: undefined
doSomething.prototype.foo:  bar
