// A callback function is a function that is passed to another function as an
// argument and is executed after some operation has been completed. Below is
// an example of a simple callback function that logs to the console after some
// operations have been completed.

function modifyArray(arr, callback) {
  // do something to arr here
  arr.push(100);
  // then execute the callback function that was passed
  callback();
}

let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

modifyArray(arr, () => {
  console.log("array has been modified", arr);
});
