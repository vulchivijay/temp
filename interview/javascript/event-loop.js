// JavaScript Event Loop Explained

// “How is JavaScript asynchronous and single-threaded?” The short answer is that JavaScript
// language is single-threaded and the asynchronous behavior is not part of the JavaScript language
// itself, rather they are built on top of the core JavaScript language in the browser
// (or the programming environment) and accessed through the browser APIs.

// To monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will
// take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it.
// Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event loop.

// As long as that while loop is running, the event loop is blocked. There's a setTimeout() that wants
// to fire in 1 second, but it can't actually call its callback until the interpreter gets back to the
// event loop. But, it won't get back to the event loop until the while () loop is done.

// Basic Architecture
// Heap - Objects are allocated in a heap which is just a name to denote a large mostly unstructured
// region of memory

// Stack - This represents the single thread provided for JavaScript code execution. Function calls
// form a stack of frames (more on this below)

// Browser or Web APIs are built into your web browser, and are able to expose data from the browser
// and surrounding computer environment and do useful complex things with it. They are not part of the
// JavaScript language itself, rather they are built on top of the core JavaScript language, providing
// you with extra superpowers to use in your JavaScript code. For example, the Geolocation API provides
// some simple JavaScript constructs for retrieving location data so you can say, plot your location on
// a Google Map. In the background, the browser is actually using some complex lower-level code (e.g. C++)
// to communicate with the device’s GPS hardware (or whatever is available to determine position data),
// retrieve position data, and return it to the browser environment to use in your code. But again, this
// complexity is abstracted away from you by the API

function main(){
  console.log('A');
  setTimeout(function display(){
    console.log('B');
  },0);
  console.log('C');
}
main();
// Output
// A
// C
// B

// 1. The call to the main function is first pushed into the stack (as a frame). Then the browser pushes
// the first statement in the main function into the stack which is console.log(‘A’). This statement is
// executed and upon completion that frame is popped out. Alphabet A is displayed in the console.

// 2. The next statement (setTimeout() with callback exec() and 0ms wait time) is pushed into the call
// stack and execution starts. setTimeout function uses a Browser API to delay a callback to the provided
// function. The frame (with setTimeout) is then popped out once the handover to browser is complete
// (for the timer).

// 3. console.log(‘C’) is pushed to the stack while the timer runs in the browser for the callback to
// the exec() function. In this particular case, as the delay provided was 0ms, the callback will be added
// to the message queue as soon as the browser receives it (ideally).

// 4. After the execution of the last statement in the main function, the main() frame is popped out
// of the call stack, thereby making it empty. For the browser to push any message from the queue to the
// call stack, the call stack has to be empty first. That is why even though the delay provided in the
// setTimeout() was 0 seconds, the callback to exec() has to wait till the execution of all the frames in
// the call stack is complete.

// 5. Now the callback exec() is pushed into the call stack and executed. The alphabet C is display
// on the console. This is the event loop of javascript.

function main(){
  console.log('A');
  setTimeout(
    function exec(){ console.log('B'); }
  , 0);
  runWhileLoopForNSeconds(3);
  console.log('C');
}

main();

function runWhileLoopForNSeconds(sec){
  let start = Date.now(), now = start;
  while (now - start < (sec*1000)) {
    now = Date.now();
  }
}
// Output
// A
// C
// B
